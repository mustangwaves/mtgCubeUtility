# mtgCubeUtility
mtg cube testing tool

This project idea is a mtg tool for testing and improving cubes; the tool will take a text file with a list of cards in the cube and allow the user to specify how many players and cards per player to create a sealed pool for each player to use. The players can then create a deck and play online with the pool of cards. The tool will also allow users to draft by making 15 card packs, allowing players to select a card from the pack. Then, the pack is passed to the next player. This process repeats until the last card is taken out of the pack. Then, the next pack is opened until all players have a 45-card pool to build a deck. If I think of other features, I may add them here.
